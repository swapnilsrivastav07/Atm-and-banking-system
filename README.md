# Atm-and-banking-system
The above project is a simple implementation of an ATM and banking system using C++. It consists of a BankAccount class that represents a bank account and provides functionalities such as deposit, withdrawal, and balance display.

In the BankAccount class, private member variables store the account number, account holder's name, and the account balance. Public member functions are defined to perform various operations on the account.

The main function serves as a demonstration of the project. It creates an instance of the BankAccount class, initializes it with an account number and account holder name, and then performs transactions like depositing and withdrawing money. Finally, it displays the updated account balance.

This project can be expanded by incorporating additional features like PIN verification, multiple accounts, transaction history, account management, and more. It serves as a starting point for building a more comprehensive ATM and banking system in C++
